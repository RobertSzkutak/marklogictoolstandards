Welcome to the MarkLogic Tool Standards project!

This project aims to provide useful standards, best practices, and guidance around laying out applications that target MarkLogic. This will allow all the open source deploy tools (Roxy, mjlsadmin, ml-gradle et al) to use the same source application folder layouts - providing consistency amongst all application deployments.

This will allow developers to choose their favourite tools safe in the knowledge that the same distributed application will work with their preferred toolset.

## Phase 1 - Document what is there

We're documenting the tools available right now, and what we want them to do.

- [What tools are available?](documentation/ToolList.md)
- [Current Tool Deployment Tasks](documentation/DeployTasks.md)

## Phase 2 - Agree goals

We need to agree the goals of the project/effort.

- [Goals of the project](documentation/Goals.md)

## Phase 3 - Create standards road map

All of the below are a work in progress...

- [Application Foldering Layout](documentation/Foldering.md)
- [Target Environment Configuration Files](documentation/ConfigFiles.md)

## Phase 4 - Implement standards in tools

TODO define which tools will implement what, by when.
